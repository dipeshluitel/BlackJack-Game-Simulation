Initial Cards: Both the player and dealer receive two cards. The player's cards are revealed, while only one of the dealer's cards is shown.

Dealer's Turn: The dealer draws cards until the total is at least 17.

Final Comparison: The game compares the player's and dealer's totals to declare the winner.
